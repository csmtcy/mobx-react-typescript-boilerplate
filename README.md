Initial run:

* Install Node.js / Yarn
* `yarn run dev`  // for development live reload + hot reload and served from http://localhost:3000
* `yarn run build` // for production build

**TODO List**
- ~~Added babel~~
- ~~create production and development environment~~
- ~~Hot module reload~~
- ~~.env or global config file~~
- ~~Sass~~
- ~~remove Devtools from production~~
- ~~add mobx-state-tree~~
