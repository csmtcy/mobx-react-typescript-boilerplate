# React-Mobx-TypeScript

Boilerplate for SPA (React + Typescript + Mobx + React Router + Sass + i18n)


Initial run:

* Install Node.js / Yarn
* `yarn run dev`  // for development live reload + hot reload and served from http://localhost:3000
* `yarn run build` // for production build

**TODO List**
- ~~Added babel~~
- ~~create production and development environment~~
- ~~Hot module reload~~
- ~~.env or global config file~~
- ~~Sass~~
- ~~remove Devtools from production~~
- ~~add mobx-state-tree~~
- ~~add react-router~~
- ~~Better directory structure~~
- ~~https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce as basic UI template~~
- ~~I18n support~~
- ~~add local storage~~ // refer to ignite
- ~~API request using axios~~
- ~~Loading icon for certain area usage (https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader)~~
- ~~docker for production~~
- ~~build files encoding problem maybe~~

**Future TODO List**
